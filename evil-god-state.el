;;; Commentary:
;; This is an evil-mode state for using god-mode.

;; It provides a command `evil-execute-in-god-state' that switches to
;; `god-local-mode' for the next command. I bind it to ","
;;
;;     (evil-define-key 'normal global-map "," 'evil-execute-in-god-state)
;;
;; for an automatically-configured leader key.
;;
;; Since `evil-god-state' includes an indicator in the mode-line, you may want
;; to use `diminish' to keep your mode-line uncluttered, e.g.
;;
;;     (add-hook 'evil-god-state-entry-hook (lambda () (diminish 'god-local-mode)))
;;     (add-hook 'evil-god-state-exit-hook (lambda () (diminish-undo 'god-local-mode)))

;; It's handy to be able to abort a `evil-god-state' command.  The following
;; will make the <ESC> key unconditionally exit evil-god-state.
;;     (evil-define-key 'god global-map [escape] 'evil-god-state-bail)
